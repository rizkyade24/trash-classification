# Trash Classification Model
<br>
**Project Overview**<br>
This project is a trash classification model that uses a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying images of trash into six categories:

- Cardboard
- Glass
- Metal
- Paper
- Plastic
- Trash
The model is trained using the TrashNet dataset, which contains labeled images of various types of trash. This project includes code for downloading and preprocessing the dataset, training the model, and making predictions.
